# PowerShell GitHub Deployment - Summary

## 🎯 The Better Way: Keep Your Organized Structure!

Instead of flattening your folders, use **Push-ToGitHub.ps1** to maintain your organized structure on GitHub while the
update script handles flattening automatically in Bitburner.

---

## ✨ What's Different Now

### ❌ Old Way (Flattening)

```
Organized Folders → Flatten → Upload to GitHub → Download to Bitburner
```

### ✅ New Way (Keep Organized)

```
Organized Folders → Push to GitHub → Auto-flatten when downloading to Bitburner
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Keeps folders organized on GitHub
- ✅ One-command push with PowerShell
- ✅ Full Git version control
- ✅ Automatic flattening in Bitburner

## 📦 Files Created

### 1. **Push-ToGitHub.ps1** (PowerShell Automation)

**Purpose:** Push your organized folder structure to GitHub with one command

**Features:**

- First-time setup with -FirstTime flag
- Automatic .gitignore creation
- Git initialization
- Commit and push automation
- Shows your GitHub raw URL
- Error handling

**Usage:**

```powershell
# First time
.\Push-ToGitHub.ps1 -RepoUrl "https://github.com/user/repo.git" -FirstTime

# Regular updates
.\Push-ToGitHub.ps1 -RepoUrl "https://github.com/user/repo.git" -CommitMessage "Fixed batch logic"
```

### 2. **bitburner-update.js** (UPDATED)

**Purpose:** Downloads scripts from organized GitHub folders to flat Bitburner structure

**Key Changes:**

- Now supports organized folder structure
- Maps folders: core/, batch/, analysis/, utils/, deploy/
- Downloads from folders but saves flat to Bitburner home
- Added --analysis flag for analysis scripts

**Configuration:**

```javascript
const baseUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main";

const folders = {
  core: `${baseUrl}/core`,
  batch: `${baseUrl}/batch`,
  analysis: `${baseUrl}/analysis`,
  utils: `${baseUrl}/utils`,
  deploy: `${baseUrl}/deploy`,
};
```

**Usage:**

```bash
run bitburner-update.js --all        # All scripts
run bitburner-update.js --essential  # Essential only
run bitburner-update.js --analysis   # Analysis tools
run bitburner-update.js --utils      # Utilities
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repo

```
1. Go to github.com/new
2. Name: bitburner-scripts
3. Visibility: Private (FREE!)
4. Create
5. Copy the repo URL
```

### Step 2: First Push

```powershell
.\Push-ToGitHub.ps1 -RepoUrl "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bitburner-scripts.git" -FirstTime
```

### Step 3: Configure Update Script

```javascript
// Edit bitburner-update.js line 15
const baseUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bitburner-scripts/main";
```

### Step 4: Push Updated Script

```powershell
.\Push-ToGitHub.ps1 -RepoUrl "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bitburner-scripts.git" -CommitMessage "Configure update script"
```

### Step 5: First Run in Bitburner

```bash
wget YOUR_RAW_URL/bitburner-update.js bitburner-update.js
run bitburner-update.js --all
```

---

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

```
1. Edit scripts in organized folders
2. Run: .\Push-ToGitHub.ps1 -RepoUrl "URL" -CommitMessage "Your changes"
3. In game: run bitburner-update.js --all
4. Done!
```

## 📁 Structure Maintained

### On GitHub (Organized)

```
bitburner-scripts/
├── core/
│   ├── attack-hack.js
│   ├── attack-grow.js
│   └── attack-weaken.js
├── batch/
│   ├── simple-batcher.js
│   └── batch-manager.js
├── analysis/
├── utils/
├── deploy/
└── bitburner-update.js
```

### In Bitburner (Flat)

```
home/
├── attack-hack.js
├── attack-grow.js
├── attack-weaken.js
├── simple-batcher.js
├── batch-manager.js
└── bitburner-update.js
```

**The update script handles the conversion automatically!**

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Push-ToGitHub.ps1** pushes your organized structure to GitHub
2. GitHub stores it with folders intact
3. **bitburner-update.js** reads from folder URLs:
   - `core/attack-hack.js`
   - `batch/simple-batcher.js`
4. But saves flat to Bitburner home:
   - `attack-hack.js`
   - `simple-batcher.js`

**Best of both worlds!**
